/// Metastore meant to manage Quickwit's indexes and their splits.
///
/// Quickwit needs a way to ensure that we can cleanup unused files,
/// and this process needs to be resilient to any fail-stop failures.
/// We rely on atomically transitioning the status of splits.
///
/// The split state goes through the following life cycle:
/// 1. `New`
///   - Create new split and start indexing.
/// 2. `Staged`
///   - Start uploading the split files.
/// 3. `Published`
///   - Uploading the split files is complete and the split is searchable.
/// 4. `MarkedForDeletion`
///   - Mark the split for deletion.
///
/// If a split has a file in the storage, it MUST be registered in the metastore,
/// and its state can be as follows:
/// - `Staged`: The split is almost ready. Some of its files may have been uploaded in the storage.
/// - `Published`: The split is ready and published.
/// - `MarkedForDeletion`: The split is marked for deletion.
///
/// Before creating any file, we need to stage the split. If there is a failure, upon recovery, we
/// schedule for deletion all the staged splits. A client may not necessarily remove files from
/// storage right after marking it for deletion. A CLI client may delete files right away, but a
/// more serious deployment should probably only delete those files after a grace period so that the
/// running search queries can complete.
